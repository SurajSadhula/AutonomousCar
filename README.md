# Autonomous Car

## Project Overview
In this project, we build an **Autonomous RC Car** using supervised learning of a neural network with a single hidden layer. The system utilizes a remote-controlled car equipped with a **Raspberry Pi** and a **Raspberry Pi camera module**.

- In **training mode**, the camera module captures images to train the neural network.  
- In **autonomous mode**, the trained model uses real-time camera input to predict the car's movements and direction.

## Project Description
The autonomous car is built on a **four-wheel Robo Car chassis** with the following layers:

1. **Base Layer**:  
   - Fitted with 5â€“12V DC motors connected via the **L298N H-Bridge Motor Driver**.  
   - Powered by **4 lithium polymer batteries** (3.7V each, connected in series for a 12V supply).  

2. **Middle Layer**:  
   - Houses the motor driver and **power bank**, which powers the Raspberry Pi.  
   - Separate power sources are used to prevent short circuits and manage load efficiently.

3. **Top Layer**:  
   - Includes the **Raspberry Pi Model 3B+** and the **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**.  
   - The camera sends data to an external PC for image processing over Wi-Fi.  
   - Processed instructions are sent back to the Raspberry Pi to control the car's movements.  

The **Arduino Uno** receives these instructions and signals the motor driver to execute them.
